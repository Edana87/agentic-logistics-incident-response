# PepsiCo Supply Chain Incident Processing - ServiceNow Implementation

## System Overview
**Company Context:**  
As a ServiceNow AI Systems Developer at PepsiCo, maintaining reliable supply chain operations is critical for delivering products to major retail partners like Whole Foods. When delivery trucks experience breakdowns, rapid financial analysis and optimal rerouting decisions are essential to minimize customer impact and avoid contractual penalties.  

**Business Problem:**  
PepsiCoâ€™s logistics operations required an intelligent system to:
- Automatically calculate delay costs based on customer contracts.
- Select optimal rerouting options considering both financial impact and delivery constraints.
- Coordinate execution with external logistics providers and customer notifications without manual intervention.  

**Project Goal:**  
Build an automated supply chain incident processing system leveraging ServiceNow AI agents and n8n workflow orchestration to reduce manual effort and improve operational efficiency.
